# Blissdle (iOS)

### By: Ben Schwartz

Blissdle (iOS) is an iOS app version of Blissdle, a solver for the popular word puzzle game Worldle. This project was developed as a way for me to learn and practice Swift development. 

The app is supposed to provide a user-friendly interface for entering letters and viewing possible words.
